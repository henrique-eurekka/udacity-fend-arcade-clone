# Project 6 - Classic Arcade Game Clone
This project is part of Udacity's Front-End Web Developer nanodegree. We develop a clone of the classic game [Frogger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frogger) applying [Object-Oriented Javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Introduction_to_Object-Oriented_JavaScript) techniques.

## Running the game

1. Download or clone this repository. If you have never done this before, [here is a guide](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/).

2. Open `index.html` with your browser.

## Playing the game

* Use the arrow keys (up, down, left, right) to move around.
* Your goal is to reach the water in the top of the screen.
* If enemies hit you, you return to the initial spot.
* Avoid enemies and reach the water to hear a pleasant sound effect.
